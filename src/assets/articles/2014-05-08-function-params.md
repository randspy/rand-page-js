With age I have started to be more restrictive with a number of parameters we can pass into a function/method.
Few years ago I would not care. Nowadays I believe that less is better. Zero is ideal. One or two are ok.
With three and more you should 
start thinking about refactoring.


But this week I went to far in this. Main reason(if there are any others) is readability.
I had created a method with two parameters instead of three and
by doing this I have reduced readability. Number of parameters has become more important than code clarity.
Apparently I become obsessed with this rule and have forgotten its true purpose. It is really
easy to get dogmatic about a given subject, like the holly programming wars.
We should be better than that. I am planing not make this mistake again.
